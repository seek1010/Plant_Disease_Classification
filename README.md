# Plant Disease Classification using CNN

This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to classify plant leaf images as healthy or affected by various diseases. Leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the model is trained on a labeled dataset of plant leaves to accurately identify and categorize different plant diseases.
