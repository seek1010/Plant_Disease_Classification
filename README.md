# Plant_Disease_Classification
This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to classify plant leaf images as healthy or affected by various diseases. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model is trained on a labeled dataset of plant leaves to accurately identify and categorize different plant diseases.
